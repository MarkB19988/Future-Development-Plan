# Future Development Plan

This plan will explain what I want to achieve 

### End Of Year One Goal
My primary goal for the end of 2018 is to have completed my first year of my HND with atleast all Merits but prefereably all Distinctions.

### Skills to Develop
To achieve this I will need to work on my time management skills in order to complete my college projects by the deadline and to complete them to the best of my ability
